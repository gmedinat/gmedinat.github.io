# Galactic archaeology with variable stars

Galactic archaeology uses present-day stellar populations as tools to reconstruct the formation and evolution of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. 
Pulsating variable stars play a paramount part in gal arch, since they reprresent stellar populations in uniquely identifiable evolutionary phases and can be used as precise standard candles. That is, their distances are known with high precision due to the well-known correlation between their periods of pulsation and their intrinsic brightness.
Over the last decade, I have conducted studies focusing on RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids to unravel the Milky Way's history from different but complementary perspectives. 
Here, I summarize my research and its outcomes. 

## RR Lyrae stars

<p style="text-align: justify;">
RR Lyrae stars are old (> 10 Gyr) low-mass variables that, in terms of stellar evolution, lie in the intersection between the horizontal giant branch (HB) and the instability strip. 
Thus, they are found in systems that contain old stellar populations. 
They are typically found to pulsate in the fundamental mode (RRab) or in the first-overtone mode (RRc), but they are also observed to pulsate in both modes simultaneously (RRd). 
These stars have been considered to be the swiss-army knives of Galactic archaeology, 
Owing to their relative abundance in the Milky Way halo, dwarf galaxies, and globular clusters, and their multiple useful properties, these stars have been considered to be the swiss-army knives of Galactic archaeology.

### The Halo Outskirts With Variable Stars (HOWVAST) survey: Exploring the Galactic outskirts with RR Lyrae stars

        The two plots here have shading? I'm trying to decipher these titles but I don't know anything haha. Anyways, you are awesome and are doing so much! I hope this website helps show people all the things you do! It would be really cool for you to have a place to talk about some of the things you've done that don't really have a place anywhere in your applications. If you talk candidly about some of your outreach things in Chile, or side stuff you've done at UT, I bet people would read it and see a bit more of your personality so they could decide if you'd be a good match for their programs or not.

### Spectroscopic follow-up of outer halo RR Lyrae: a pilot study
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <p style="text-align: justify; flex: 1;">
        This image shows the halo profile. At least, that's what the title says. I don't really know what the rest of the words in the file name mean, but I bet you do! anyways, here's another block of text so we can see that this time, the image is on the right side and the test is on the left. I hope this all is working. using html here is bringing me back to my Neopets days, when I first figured out coding so I could customize my neopet's profiles haha. I was such a nerd.

## Classical Cepheids


<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the most studied types of variable stars are classical Cepheids (also known as Î´
Cepheids or type I Cepheids). These stars are young and metal-rich variables typically pulsating in the fundamental mode or in the first overtone.
Their lifetimes are short, ranging from 10 Myr to a few 100 Myr. 
Thus, these stars are commonly found in regions that have undergone recent star formation episodes (e.g., in the Milky Way disk). 
</p>

### Studying classical Cepheids in open clusters


<img src="{{ 'Figures/galacticMap2_dark_bg_transp.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Galactic Map" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%"> 
<p style="text-align: justify; flex: 1;">   
    Classical Cepheids occurring in open clusters are key for the study of stellar populations, as both can be used as tracers of recent star formation episodes, and provide valuable tests of stellar evolution models. Such tests include the calibration of the Leavitt law, the period-age relation of Cepheids, the efficiency of cluster dissolution mechanisms, among others. Throughout the last decades, however, dedicated efforts have led to a relatively small number of reported bona fide Galactic cluster Cepheids, suggesting that the vast majority of Cepheids do not reside in clusters.   
</p>    
<p style="text-align: justify; flex: 1;">   
    In <a href="[https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/people/post-docs/name/gustavo-medina/](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1342M/abstract)" target="_blank">Medina, Lemasle, & Grebel (2021)</a>, we conducted an all-sky search for classical Cepheids in Galactic open clusters taking advantage of the unprecedented astrometric precision and homogeneity of the Gaia space mission (data release 3). We determined the membership of Cepheids to clusters using the most up-to-date catalogues and following a Bayesian approach, taking the spatial and kinematic information of the potential cluster-Cepheid pairs into account. We confirmed several Cepheid-cluster associations considered in previous studies as bona-fide, and questioned the established cluster membership of a handful of other associations. Additionally, we identified a considerable number of new potential cluster Cepheid candidates, mostly in recently discovered clusters. We explored the feasibility of using open clusters hosting Cepheids to empirically test the Cepheid period-age relation through a semi-automated method to derive cluster ages (based on isochrones).
